# ⚖️ Governance: Digital Shura (Shura 2.0)

## Abstract
Traditional decision-making in the Islamic world often suffers from improved latency and lack of transparency. **Digital Shura** is a proposal to use cryptographic proof and consensus algorithms to modernize the concept of "Consultation" (Shura).

## Core Principles

### 1. Fluid Democracy (Delegated Voting)
Not every citizen can be an expert on everything. We propose a **Liquid Democracy** model where:
*   Users can vote directly on issues.
*   OR they can delegate their vote to a trusted expert (e.g., an economist for trade deals, a scholar for ethical issues).
*   Delegation can be withdrawn instantly.

### 2. The Council System
*   **Local Councils (Mahalle)**: Handle local issues.
*   **City Councils**: Aggregated votes from locals.
*   **The High Council**: Representatives from all member states/communities.

### 3. Smart Treaties
Agreements between parties are not just paper; they are **Smart Contracts**.
*   *Example*: "If Country A invests X amount in Country B, then 5% of the revenue is automatically routed back to Country A's treasury wallet."
*   This removes the need for "trust" and relies on "truth" (code).

## Roadmap to Implementation
1.  Define the `VotingToken` standard (ERC-20/721 variant).
2.  Build a prototype dApp for a small community organization.
3.  Draft the "Constitution of the Digital Union".
