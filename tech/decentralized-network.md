# 📡 Technology: The Sovereign Stack

## Abstract
A nation that does not control its own data does not control its own destiny. This module defines the "Hardware and Software" independence of the Union.

## The 3-Layer Defense

### 1. The Physical Layer: "Iron-Dome" Connectivity
*   **Mesh Networks**: Community-owned ISP nodes. If the main internet cable is cut, the neighborhood mesh keeps talking.
*   **Satellite Uplink**: Leveraging Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites for independent global routing.
*   **Halal Silicon**: Investing in Open Source Hardware (RISC-V) to ensure our verify the chip-level security (no backdoors).

### 2. The Data Layer: "The Vault"
*   **Decentralized Storage (IPFS/Filecoin)**: No central server to bomb or sanction. Data is sharded and replicated across millions of nodes in the Ummah.
*   **Sovereign Cloud**: A federation of national data centers running open-source cloud stacks (OpenStack/Kubernetes), keeping data within our legal jurisdictions.

### 3. The Application Layer: "The Halal Internet"
*   **Social Algorithms**: Social media that amplifies *truth* and *knowledge* rather than outrage.
*   **Identity**: Self-Sovereign Identity (DID). You own your passport, not a government database.

## Strategic Projects
*   **Crescent-OS**: A hardened, privacy-focused Linux distribution for government and military use.
*   **Ummah-Search**: A search engine index that prioritizes ethical and verified content.
